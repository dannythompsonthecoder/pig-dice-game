Game Rules.
This is an acual game played with dice. Each roll is worth the points shown on the dice i.e. if you roll a 6 it is worth 6 points.

Rolling a 1 ends your turn, you will lose all the points you didn't save for that round and that leads it to the next players turn.
Save your points you have earned in that round adds the points to your total score. If you do not save them and roll a 1 you will lose them. 

Once you save your points your turn ends and it goes to the next player.

the traditional game goes to 100 points. I made this code for it to go to 20 so it is easier to play and test. Very fast games. If you want to change this, you can easily do so in the javascript code in pigGame.js.
